  return (
    <MediaProvider>
      // [!code ++]
      <PlayerHooks />
      <Suspense>
        <Layout.RootContainer height={720} width={1280}>
          <Layout.PlayerContainer>
            <MediaElement />
            <Layout.ControlsContainer>
              <BottomControls />
            </Layout.ControlsContainer>
          </Layout.PlayerContainer>
        </Layout.RootContainer>
      </Suspense>
    </MediaProvider>
  )
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding

This library uses Shaka Player as the default playback engine. Hooks like `useShakaPlayer` (engine setup) and `useMediaStates` (media state) are singletons. Rendering them via the `<PlayerHooks />` component prevents re-initializing these hooks on every render. While you could co-locate such hooks alongside each molecule/component, centralizing them keeps behavior predictable and avoids redundant work.

You can add as many hooks as you need inside the `<PlayerHooks />` component.
