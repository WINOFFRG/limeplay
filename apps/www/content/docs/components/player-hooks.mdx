title: Player Hooks
description: Central top level memoized hook for component level state management
---

This library uses Shaka Player as the default player engine, most components rely on custom hooks like `useShakaPlayer` to setup the player engine or `useMediaStates` to setup the media state are all singleton. Adding the hooks in `<PlayerHooks />` component prevents re-initialization of the hooks on every render. Ideally, we can have those hooks parallel to each molecular component without any issues but as a best practice we memoize the hooks in a single place.

You can add as many hooks as you want in `<PlayerHooks />` component.

## Usage

Add in your existing `MediaPlayer` component.

```tsx lineNumbers=6 title="components/player/media-player.tsx"
import { PlayerHooks } from "@/registry/default/ui/player-hooks" // [!code ++]

// ... other imports

export function MediaPlayer() {
  return (
    <MediaProvider>
      // [!code ++]
      <PlayerHooks />
      <Suspense>
        <Layout.RootContainer height={720} width={1280}>
          <Layout.PlayerContainer>
            <MediaElement />
            <Layout.ControlsContainer>
              <BottomControls />
            </Layout.ControlsContainer>
          </Layout.PlayerContainer>
        </Layout.RootContainer>
      </Suspense>
    </MediaProvider>
  )
}
```
