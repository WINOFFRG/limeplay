## Understanding

This poster element wraps the player layout and serves two common use cases:

1. Acts as a cover image for the player when in Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode to remove the native black overlay (inspired by Prime Video).
2. Provides a skeleton while the HTML media element loads; it will render fallback content while the media is mounting.
