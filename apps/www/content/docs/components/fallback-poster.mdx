description: Background poster image for HTML Media Element

This poster element wraps itself around the player layout and serves two useful cases:

1. Acts as a cover image for Player when in PiP mode to get rid of native black overlay, Inspired from Prime Video.
2. Provides a skeleton element for HTML Media Element while it renders

<ComponentPreview name="fallback-poster-demo" withPlayer type="overlay" />
