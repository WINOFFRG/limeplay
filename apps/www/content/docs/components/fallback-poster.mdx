## Understanding

This poster element wraps itself around the player layout and serves two useful cases:

1. Acts as a cover image for player when playing in PiP mode to get rid of native black overlay, inspired from Prime Video.
2. Provides a skeleton element for HTML Media Element while it loads, will render a fallback content while the media is mounting.
