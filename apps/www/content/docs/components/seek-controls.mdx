<ComponentPreview name="seek-control-demo" withPlayer />

## Installation


```npm
npx shadcn add @limeplay/seek-controls
```

### Ready to Use

The `SeekControl` component uses the `useSeek` hook internally, which only requires the `MediaProvider` context. No additional store setup is needed as seeking is a direct action on the media element.

## Example Usage

1. Design seek controls with icons and offset values.

```tsx lineNumbers title="components/player/seek-group-control.tsx"
"use client"

import {
  CaretCircleDoubleLeftIcon,
  CaretCircleDoubleRightIcon,
} from "@phosphor-icons/react"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { SeekControl } from "@/components/limeplay/seek-controls"

export function SeekGroupControl() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <SeekControl offset={-10} asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
          <CaretCircleDoubleLeftIcon />
        </Button>
      </SeekControl>
      <SeekControl offset={10} asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
          <CaretCircleDoubleRightIcon />
        </Button>
      </SeekControl>
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. Use the component in your player.

```tsx lineNumbers title="components/player/bottom-controls.tsx"
<SeekGroupControl />
```

## Understanding

The `SeekControl` component provides seek functionality for the media player.
