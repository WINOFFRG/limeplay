## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install the component
```npm
npx shadcn add @limeplay/seek-control
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Ready to Use

The `SeekControl` component uses the `useSeek` hook internally, which only requires the `MediaProvider` context. No additional store setup is needed as seeking is a direct action on the media element.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

1. Design seek controls with icons and offset values.

```tsx lineNumbers title="components/player/seek-group-control.tsx"
"use client"

import {
  CaretCircleDoubleLeftIcon,
  CaretCircleDoubleRightIcon,
} from "@phosphor-icons/react"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { SeekControl } from "@/components/limeplay/seek-controls"

export function SeekGroupControl() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <SeekControl offset={-10} asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
          <CaretCircleDoubleLeftIcon />
        </Button>
      </SeekControl>
      <SeekControl offset={10} asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
          <CaretCircleDoubleRightIcon />
        </Button>
      </SeekControl>
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. Use the component in your player.

```tsx lineNumbers title="components/player/bottom-controls.tsx"
<SeekGroupControl />
```

## Understanding

The `SeekControl` component provides seek functionality for the media player. Unlike volume or playback controls, seeking is a purely **action-based** operation:

- **Action Bridge**: Uses [`useSeek()`](/docs/hooks/use-seek) hook to access `seek(offset)` which directly modifies `currentTime` on the native media element
- **No Event Bridge**: No state synchronization is needed since `currentTime` is already tracked by the timeline hooks

The component automatically handles edge cases like clamping seek positions to valid ranges (0 to duration) and resets the idle state to keep controls visible after seeking.

## Components

### SeekControl

The main component for seeking forward or backward. It supports the **Slot pattern** (`asChild` prop) for composition and includes automatic ARIA labels based on the offset value.
