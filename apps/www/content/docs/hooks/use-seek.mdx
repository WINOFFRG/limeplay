title: use-seek
description: Hook for seeking forward or backward in media playback
---

import { Step, Steps } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps"

## Installation

```npm
npx shadcn add @limeplay/use-seek
```

## Example Usage

Use the `useSeek()` hook to control seeking in your components.

```tsx lineNumbers title="components/player/seek-buttons.tsx"
import { useSeek } from "@/hooks/limeplay/use-seek"

export function SeekButtons() {
  const { seek } = useSeek()

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => seek(-10)}>Back 10s</button>
      <button onClick={() => seek(10)}>Forward 10s</button>
      <button onClick={() => seek(-30)}>Back 30s</button>
      <button onClick={() => seek(30)}>Forward 30s</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Understanding

The `use-seek` hook provides direct seeking functionality following a simplified **Action Bridge** pattern:

- **Action Only**: `seek(offset)` directly modifies `currentTime` on the native media element
- **No Event Bridge**: Unlike volume or playback hooks, seeking doesn't require state synchronization since timeline state is tracked separately by [`useTimelineStates()`](/docs/hooks/use-timeline)

The hook automatically:
- Clamps seek positions to valid ranges (0 to media duration)
- Resets the `idle` state to keep player controls visible after seeking
- Handles edge cases like undefined duration gracefully
