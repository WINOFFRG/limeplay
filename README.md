  An open source UI Library built on top of React for <a href="https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player">Shaka Player</a>.
</h2>

DEVELOPER's NOTE: Project development will be continued back on 5th December!

**Motivation:** Shaka Player officially provides a great production ready UI Library built on Vanilla JS which has great optimization in terms on both memory and performance, It serves its best in all the aspects like Localization, Accessibility, Customization, etc. However, The UI doesn't meet the modern design standard for the obvious reasons. To make it more scalable, maintainable, customisable and make the best use of power of React, this library is in development.

### ðŸ’Ž Contribute: This project is in its early stage of development. Contributions, Suggestions are welcomed.
