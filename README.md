  An open source UI Library built on top of React for <a href="https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player">Shaka Player</a>.
</h2>

**Motivation:** Shaka Player officially provides a great production ready UI Library built on Vanilla JS which has great optimization in terms on both memory and performance, It serves its best in all the aspects like Localization, Accessibility, Customization, etc. However, The UI doesn't meet the modern design standard for the obvious reasons. To make it more scalable, maintainable, customisable and make the best use of power of React, this library is in development.
